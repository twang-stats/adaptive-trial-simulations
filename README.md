# Adaptive Clinical Trial Simulation Studies and Visualizations

Personal code relevant to the topic of adaptive experimental trials in general,
where interim analyses in the middle of a trial are used to evaluate whether
the experimental design itself needs to be updated, or whether there is sufficient 
information to terminate the study altogether at the interim stage.

I originally started on some of this as a part of my Master's research project, 
and I plan to add to this over time. The main reason for this is as a personal 
learning experience: I have no intention of working in academia, but I still think
that I should be learning and looking for improvements in what I have already
done. I also plan to do this work in both R and Python so as to improve my 
programming skills.
